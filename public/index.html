          <p>
            Carbon pollution from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and
            natural gas is warming our planet and causing climate change.

              <h2>Air pollution</h2>
              <p>
                it's simple: the more carbon pollution in the air, the more the
                sun's energy get trapped as heat. Which means things keep
                getting hotter. You've almost certainly heard the phrase "global
                warming"? in fact, the world has already gotten nearly 1°C
                warmer since 1880.

              <h2>Temperatures</h2>
              <p>
                Warmer Temperatures have real consequences for all of us-not
                just for polar bears. Sea levels around the world have risen
                nearly 20cm (7.8 inches) since 1901, swallowing entire islands
                and creeping closer to populated areas of great coastal cities
                like New York, Melbourne, and Dakar.

              <h2>Heat</h2>
              <p>
                Plus, extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and
                droughts are becoming more frequent and intense. Witness the
                devastation in 2017 as hurricane Harvey tore through the
                Caribbean and southern US, destroying homes and leaving millions
                without power for weeks and even months.

                One can see from space how the human race has changed the Earth.
                Nearly all of the available land has been cleared of forest and
                is now used for agriculture or urban development. The polar
                icecaps are shrinking and the desert areas are increasing. At
                night, the Earth is no longer dark, but large areas are lit up.
                All of this is evidence that human exploitation of the planet is
                reaching a critical limit. But human demands and expectations
                are ever- increasing. We cannot continue to pollute the
                atmosphere, poison the ocean and exhaust the land. There isn't
                any more available.

          <div class="container-nowrap width_half">
            <p>
              The atmosphere is a dynamic fluid that is continually in motion.
              Both its physical properties and its rate and direction of motion
              are influenced by a variety of factors, including solar radiation,
              the geographic position of continents, ocean currents, the
              location and orientation of mountain ranges, atmospheric
              chemistry, and vegetation growing on the land surface. All these
              factors change through time. Some factors, such as the
              distribution of heat within the oceans, atmospheric chemistry, and
              surface vegetation, change at very short timescales. Others, such
              as the position of continents and the location and height of
              mountain ranges, change over very long timescales. Therefore,
              climate, which results from the physical properties and motion of
              the atmosphere, varies at every conceivable timescale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Climate is often defined loosely as the average weather at a
              particular place, incorporating such features as temperature,
              precipitation, humidity, and windiness. A more specific definition
              would state that climate is the mean state and variability of
              these features over some extended time period. Both definitions
              acknowledge that the weather is always changing, owing to
              instabilities in the atmosphere. And as weather varies from day to
              day, so too does climate vary, from daily day-and-night cycles up
              to periods of geologic time hundreds of millions of years long. In
              a very real sense, climate variation is a redundant
              expression—climate is always varying. No two years are exactly
              alike, nor are any two decades, any two centuries, or any two
              millennia.
